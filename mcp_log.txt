This framework is demonstrated through the design and implementation of a novel privacy-preserving inference information flow where we pass homomorphically encrypted activation signals through a split neural network for inference. We show that splitting the model further up the computation chain significantly reduces the computation time of inference and the payload size of activation signals at the cost of model secrecy. We evaluate our proposed flow with respect to its provision of the core structural transparency principles.Show lessSee publicationGiving Back with GitHubMunich iOS MeetupMay 18, 2016A talk given by Madhava Jay about putting the open source back in iOS at the Munich iOS meetup at 18.05.2016.See publicationProjectsWeb Service API for 10,000 Steps "iSteplog" iOS applicationDec 2010- PresentWeb services API developed for use by 10,000 Steps "iSteplog" iOS application.http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22984196Solution originally developed in Python, Django, MySQL.

I was impressed with the way a 'techie' effectively communicated with people uninitiated in all that goes into web design, hosting and payment gateways.. His communication and total management of the process gave the clients exactly what they wanted even tough they weren't even sure to start with just what was involved. At every point , because of budget, he gave the clients precise instructions of who they may need to contact, what to ask for and therefore managed to produce a sophisticated result for the cost of only the specialised programming components.
Since then Madhava has provided  my company on  numerous occasions with specialist analysis and advice in areas such as HTML, FLASH conversion, native apps and virtually anything else we care to ask. Madhava is the 'go to person' in the web world.”Matthew Adam“Consistent with any position held in a small company, Madhava at times was required to handle multiple roles. Roles included “Web developer”, “network admin”, “research assistant” as well as Project Manager. Working with clients, in-house projects including start-ups with other Developers & Contractors in a professional courteous manner. He had a clear understanding of the bottom line as well as the skills to deliver a project on time and budget.

#InDebted #Trust #Compliance #Security #Vanta #StartupDaily453 CommentsJelix VenturesWhat a great panel discussion on the importance of cyber security compliance for startups. Too many focus on building their product and taking it to market only to head butt against a roadblock to an enterprise or government sale; the customers requirement for security compliance accreditation. Vanta can help with this. And it is so much more cost-effective to build in security compliance from the outset. Jelix portfolio company, SafeStack can help upskill your developers and software architects to build in security from the beginning.7Kangaroo LLM🦘 Exciting news!

FindDevs for Australian developers!Tenth Gear ConsultingCan’t decide on the best technology approach for your business? Steal this blueprint generated by AWS Professional Services for ASIC (Australian Securities and Investments Commission).

The proof of concept report (link in comments) outlines the trial comparing the quality of long document summarization between humans and AI. While humans won with a large margin, the preferred model tested (Llama 2) is already two generations behind - but the methodology is valuable for businesses managing rapid technology advancements.

It covers:
-Evaluating a business function.
-Creating and following evaluation rubric.
-Documenting test conditions that make it easier to replicate or modify in the future.
-Recording lessons learned.
-Limiting scope and timeline to arrive at a conclusion on a tight schedule.
-Dealing with the speed of technology changes.

Designating some time for research and development is essential to take advantage of new opportunities. Creating a tight-scale proof of concept helps to reduce investment and potential downsides.

I asked Claude and GPT to search for NZ's top AI consultants. Their results? Completely different from Google's traditional rankings.

#deb202426Randal B.New Post: Sydney Sweeney and the internet react to Samsung’s awkward unveiling of AI portrait based on her image - https://lnkd.in/gSg4g86y - Sydney Sweeney – and social media – has reacted to Samsung unveiling an AI-generated portrait based on her image at a live event – watch Sweeney’s awkward reaction below.

READ MORE: Sydney Sweeney doesn’t get why you’re obsessed with her: “I’m just being me”

On Wednesday \(July 10\), Sweeney attended Samsung’s Galaxy Unpacked event in Paris. During the event, which was streamed online, the camera panned to Sweeney as the company unveiled a 3D image – assisted by AI – that was generated from one Sweeney’s photos.
Sweeney was then asked for her thoughts on the generated image in real time, and social media has caught on to her awkward and uncomfortable response. “Aw, I love it. It’s amazing you can take an image like this,” she chuckles, though the lingering camera reveals a look of discomfort on the actor’s face.

Social media soon began reacting to the clip, with some users on X taking note of her “forced” reaction. “She’s trying to hold it together but her face says everything we need to know,” one user wrote, while another added: “She let out the most contractually forced ‘oh yeah, I love it'”.
